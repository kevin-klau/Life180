## About
* User logs into our app and is then directed to a page where they must enter the destination they wish to be at and how long till their arrival.
* By clicking the start timer, our react app tracks the user’s location while the timer counts down.
* If the user does not reach the destination before the timer, a notification and alert will be sent out from not only their device but from their friends’ accounts as well.
* Not only must the user hold themselves accountable but their friends will be reminding them constantly as well to avoid the notifications.
* Afterwards, the data that is stored in our database will reveal how many times the user has failed to show up to their destination on time and this will be displayed for all their friends who use the app.

## Technologies
* Google Cloud API
* React.js
* Python
